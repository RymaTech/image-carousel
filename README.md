# Image Carousel for Founders & Coders Spring 2019 Application

This is my image carousel, in application for [Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) 2019 spring course cohort. It was submitted on 31 December 2018.

## Features

*No libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap.
*Responsive (works on mobile and desktop).
*Display one image at a time.
*Move between images when clicking navigation buttons.
*Toggle automatically looping through all images with a play/pause button.
*Allow keyboard navigation between images with the left/right arrow keys.

## Additional features

*I have implemented slide tracker which consists of four markers (dots). The markers highlight at which stage the slider
is at. (first marker highlights when first slide is showing, second marker when second slide is showing etc).
*Space Bar to hit play and pause.
